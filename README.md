# MorseCodeProcessor
This project is a application of Digital Signal Processing with Morse Code. It has two modules: a generator and a receiver.
The purpose of the generator is to make a audio file containing some text encoded in morse code. The user can add additive white gaussian noise to the audio.
The receiver, on the other hand, reads a audio file containing a Morse Code message, applies some filtering and try to recover the original text encoded.
